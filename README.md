## How It Works

The app uses an intelligent progression system that unlocks letters based on your mastery:

1. **Start with 5 core letters**: alef (Ø§), beh (Ø¨), sin (Ø³), mim (Ù…), dal (Ø¯)
2. **Unlock new groups as you improve**:
   - Group 2: nun (Ù†), lam (Ù„), reh (Ø±), yeh (ÛŒ), vav (Ùˆ)
   - Group 3: teh (Øª), peh (Ù¾), jim (Ø¬), cheh (Ú†)
   - Group 4: kaf (Ú©), heh (Ù‡), ain (Ø¹), ghain (Øº)
   - And 3 more groups...

**New letters unlock when**:
- You achieve 70%+ accuracy on current letters
- Each letter has been practiced at least 5 times
- At least 80% of active letters have been practiced

Each letter form (isolated, initial, medial, final) is tracked separately because Persian letters change significantly between positions. The system won't overwhelm you - if you're struggling, it waits until you're ready before adding new letters.

## Migrating Your Progress

To transfer your progress (e.g., from local development to the online version):

1. **Export from your current version**:
   - Go to the Progress page
   - Scroll to "Data Management" 
   - Click "Export Progress"
   - Save the JSON file

2. **Import to the new version**:
   - Go to the Progress page
   - Click "Import Progress"
   - Select your saved JSON file
   - Your progress will be restored instantly

This is especially useful when moving from `localhost` to the GitHub Pages version at https://jotoft.github.io/aleph/
